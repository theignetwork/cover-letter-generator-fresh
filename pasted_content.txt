Cover Letter Generator PRO — Deployment and Prompt Logic Instructions
Objective:
Fully deploy and host the Cover Letter Generator PRO tool on your end (similar to the Salary Decoder deployment). The tool should be fully functional, polished, and production-ready, with OpenAI-powered generation and all interactive features working as specified below.

OpenAI Integration and Prompt Logic:
Use the following prompt structure for cover letter generation:

Prompt Structure (Inject Variables as Shown):

You are an expert career advisor and resume coach, helping job seekers write targeted, effective cover letters that impress hiring managers.

Write a personalized cover letter based on the following job description:
[Insert Job Description Here]

The selected tone for this letter is: [Formal / Friendly / Bold / Problem-Solution / Direct to Hiring Manager].

If provided, please weave this achievement or key strength into the letter where it makes the most impact:
[Insert Achievement]

Here are the top keywords and skills extracted from the job description:
[Extracted Keywords List]

The cover letter should:

Open with a strong, human-sounding introduction that grabs attention.

Align the user’s skills and experience directly with the requirements from the job description.

Use the extracted keywords naturally throughout the letter.

Focus on action verbs, achievements, and quantifiable results where possible.

Close with a confident, engaging conclusion that expresses enthusiasm for the role.

Use clear, natural, and professional language. The letter should not sound robotic or overly formal. Keep the total length under 400 words.

If no achievement is provided, focus on aligning skills and experience to the job description.

Please output only the cover letter text — no extra commentary.

Use GPT-4.1

Temperature: 0.7

Insert the prompt as the user message with the system prompt:
“You are a helpful and experienced job search assistant.”

Inputs (Required for Prompt Logic):
jobDescription: The pasted job description from the user.

tone: User-selected tone option.

achievement: Optional user-provided achievement.

extractedKeywords: Keywords parsed from the job description.

Keyword Matching / Extraction Logic:
Extract 5–10 key skills/keywords from the job description via frequency analysis.

Feed these keywords directly into the prompt as [Extracted Keywords List].

Display these as a Keyword Bubble Cloud in the UI.

Visual indicators:

✅ Green = Keyword included in the letter.

⚠️ Yellow = Keyword missing from the letter.

Refinement Button Logic:

Button Name	Action
Strengthen Opener	Re-run generation with the added system prompt: “Make the opening sentence stronger and more engaging.”
Add Achievement Focus	Re-run with: “Emphasize the user’s achievement more prominently in the letter.”
Shorten Letter for Readability	Re-run with: “Make the letter more concise while keeping key points intact. Limit to 300 words.”
Do not just append these instructions to the original prompt.
Instead, use them as refinement system prompts or modify the original prompt logic accordingly on each re-run.

Interview Guys Tip Behavior:
Do not use a static tip.

Rotate from a curated list OR optionally generate dynamic tips via GPT with:
“Provide one quick tip for writing a great cover letter for [job title] roles.”

Example Tip Pool:

“Use numbers and results — like ‘increased revenue by 30%.’”

“Mirror the company’s values directly from the job description.”

“Keep your opener short but impactful. Avoid cliches like ‘I’m writing to apply.’”

User Interface Notes:
Ensure clear labels and tooltips on the Keyword Bubble Cloud (e.g., “Top Skills Extracted from Job Description”).

Refinement buttons should briefly explain their purpose when hovered or clicked.

Add a short “How This Works” explanation at the top or via a help icon (?).

Maintain the dark mode theme with navy, teal, white, and soft blue accent colors.

Mobile-first responsive design (but clean on desktop as well).

Include “Powered by The IG Network” branding in the footer or header.

Hosting Request:
Please handle full deployment and hosting of the working tool.

Provide the public link for embedding on our members-only page.

I will supply the OpenAI API key if needed for deployment.

Please confirm receipt of these instructions and let me know if anything is unclear. I’m looking forward to getting this fully operational.

Thank you.
